In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through deploying a production-ready Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform, implementing industry best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions
- Terraform installed (v1.5+)
- kubectl installed
- AWS CLI configured

## Infrastructure Overview

Our EKS cluster will include:
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Managed node groups with auto-scaling
- IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
- Network policies and security groups
- Monitoring with CloudWatch

## Key Terraform Modules

```hcl
module "eks" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version = "~> 19.0"

  cluster_name    = var.cluster_name
  cluster_version = "1.28"

  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets

  eks_managed_node_groups = {
    production = {
      min_size     = 2
      max_size     = 10
      desired_size = 3

      instance_types = ["t3.large"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Enable encryption at rest** for EKS secrets
2. **Implement RBAC** for fine-grained access control
3. **Use private endpoints** for API server access
4. **Enable audit logging** for compliance

## Conclusion

This setup provides a solid foundation for running production workloads on EKS while maintaining security and scalability standards.
