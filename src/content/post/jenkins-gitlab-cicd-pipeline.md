Learn how to build a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates your entire software delivery process from code commit to production deployment.

## Pipeline Architecture

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of:
- GitLab for source control and webhook triggers
- Jenkins for orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- SonarQube for code quality
- Nexus for artifact management

## Jenkins Pipeline Script

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t app:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            parallel {
                stage('Unit Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'npm test'
                    }
                }
                stage('Security Scan') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'trivy image app:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                branch 'main'
            }
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Benefits

- **Automated testing** reduces bugs in production
- **Faster deployment** cycles
- **Consistent environments** across stages
- **Rollback capabilities** for quick recovery
